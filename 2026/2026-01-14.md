Shirai:  
- separate between gender  
- compare to human ability?  
- what is the end goal, to compare with human or see if such mechanism exist in SSL model?  
- any intuition on using layer instead of epoch?  
- different slide number 9 and 10  --> language 

Yuting:  
- page 22 should be for English, right? 
- part of UK or all, check for each dialect 
- Construct linear model  
- Pearson correlation is more proper than Spearmann 
- Try other SSL UK models  
- Try different layers  

Hu:  
- proposing idea to use audio as input to generate image (in addition to video and denoise)  
- need to concretize the end goal, for example, when the eyes open, and how much  

Nguyen:  
- Use same data as previous (WSJ)  
- How to measure the performance?  STOI, WER, CER   

Han:  
- Evaluate TCN with late fusion multi features
- What is the motivation for each part?
- We what to see is consistency among different dataset  
- connection between parts  

Nadim:  
- Try smaller data for quick experimentation  
- Did you use language target to transcribe?  
- Check the performance randomly  
- Check if the same sentence occur on both genuine and spoofed  
- Analysis of language-based fake detection  

Raj:  
- potential problem: change rule-based character constituency with neural-based character constituency  

Sherwyn: 
- adding LLM to read transcript for answering questions
