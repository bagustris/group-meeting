# 2025-05-27 group discussions  

Bagus:  
- Dementia prediction from speech, added the following acoustic features:
   - proportian pause duration, 
- Use singularity in all machine (pc, naist server, etc)
- implement paraCLAP

Shun:  
- Bug fixing didn't improve
- lognormal distribution didn't work
- lognormal segmentation didn't work
- 18 languages can be train using commonvoice
- take some part of wavtokenizer

Yuting:  
- tried https://github.com/andrespimartin/weighted-x-entropy-asr/, failed
- try again, change dataset directory and output
- access naist server from outside

Hu:  
- move from pytorch to pytorch-lightning  
- try flow-matching for image generation 
- combined flow-mathcing and vae
- dataset only image no description
- real image has problems: dataset, details, computation

Baptiste:  
- evaluate single and mix datasets
- try to implement something ()
