Han Peichan:
- Channel in EEG related to audiotory and language processing and understanding
- Alice in Wonderland EEG data (music listening)
- If you didn't continue your experiment from the last meeting, please let us know why
- manual identification and improve EEG quality  
- Does the channel number consistent across different devices (26 + 23)
- Expected 80-90 percent (accuracy?): what is the metric to compare the ground truth and predicted EEG?
- Mahmood sensei: it is possible to predict from low level (acoustic) to greater level (EEG)
- How to solve the discrepancy between the EEG data across participants?
- What is the importance of converting speech to EEG?

Toru-Shirai:  
- recom: Using LLM to improve more text quality
- Using whisper as speech encoder
- What is the main problem and contribution of the research?  

Chung Tran:  
- Presenting multimodal LLM
- Currently applying to speech and image to answer questions

Zhou Wangzizi:
- Improving the quality of synthesized speech (UT-MOS and WER)
- Using Energy and Pitch as features to improve expressive TTS

Michael:  
- Did you need really machine translation?
- What is the input data you used?
- How to make "narrative" or "storry/telling" style TTS?
